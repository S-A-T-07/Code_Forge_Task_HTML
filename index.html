        <h3>Why is Steph Curry unique?</h3>
        Second, playing is always the best way to go.Experience cannot be replicated in practice, and indeed, a big part of what has made Curry so special as a professional is his unparalleled ability to dominate a game as a shooter and scorer both on and off
        the ball.He got the opportunity to do both at Davidson.Currently one of the best and most popular players in the NBA, Curry is already one of the greatest NBA shooters of all-time.He shoots the three-pointer from half-court, and spectators can
        always count on his accuracy and efficiency to increase dramatically as he gets further away from the basket. Despite this, his shooting style is actually quite ordinary, but he is fast and very difficult to block. Steph Curry is unanimously recognised
        by all experts and basketball fans as the best shooter in the history of the NBA. He made the most three-pointers in a season ever. Curry makes a three-point shot look easy, with fans watching in disbelief every time he steps onto the court. His
        game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, played on the night between December 14 and 15 2021, will go down in history as one of the best!
